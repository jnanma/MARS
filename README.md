# MARS
integrating Multi-omics Annotation into Residual Split indirect deep learning model for efficient and robust genomic prediction.ðŸš€

## About

MARS is a PyTorch-based framework for genomic prediction (GP), featuring implementations of:
* two-step strategy which machieves segmented modeling of linear and nonlinear, additive and interaction effects
* hierarchical feature selection strategy
* various non-linear models with customizable parameters

### Motivation

MARS integrates the two-step strategy and hierarchical feature selection.
 MARS offers a modular and user-friendly workflow for GP.
 It is easy to set parameters, and to configure the model, and to train and test.


## Getting started guide

To help you get started, we provide a ```config_template.json``` config file where supported attributes, their meaning and possible values are explained. 
 All the hyperparameters of the training procedure: i.e. data location, model defintion, training hyperparametrs etc. are controlled by the ```config.json``` file. 
 Organize and input phenotype and genotype files according to the requirements in the temporary file.
  
  
To train and predict, run 

```python MARS/main.py --json_path MARS (the path of config file named 'config.json')```  
The ```json_path``` specifies the directory containing the configuration file, not the file itself. The configuration file must be named ```config.json```.  
  
  
A ```main.py``` code file includes 5 modules:   
 * data preprocessing
 * GBLUP prediction
 * hierarchical feature selection
 * model training
 * final prediction


## Note
Before running MARS, it is necessary to download the [```HIBLUP```](https://www.hiblup.com/)  software .
